## Deloitte Australia Technology Job Simulation on Forage - July 2025


## Task -1
 Completed a job simulation involving development and coding
 

# Goal:
Write a Python program that converts machine telemetry data from two different formats into a single, unified format suitable for displaying on a dashboard.


This is useful for integrating systems where data sources vary, but you need one consistent format to feed into monitoring tools or dashboards.


# ✅ Example Use Case

Imagine you're building a dashboard for a company like Daikibo that monitors machines across multiple factories:

Some older systems export data in ISO format.

Some newer ones use epoch timestamps.

The dashboard backend needs one consistent format to work reliably.

Your Task 1 solution is the data normalization layer that prepares this data — a common requirement in real-world software engineering and system integration.
